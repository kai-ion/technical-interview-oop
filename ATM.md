### OOP Question: Design an ATM System

**Question:**

Design an object-oriented ATM (Automated Teller Machine) system. The system should allow users to perform basic transactions such as withdrawing money, depositing money, checking account balances, and transferring money between accounts. The system must ensure security by validating PIN numbers and ensuring sufficient funds for transactions.

**Requirements:**
1. **Classes**:
   - **Account**: Represents a bank account with attributes like account number, balance, and methods to perform actions like deposit, withdraw, and check balance.
   - **User**: Represents a user with attributes like name, user ID, and a list of accounts they own. Each user has a PIN for authentication.
   - **ATM**: Represents the ATM itself, which provides the interface for performing transactions. It should handle user authentication and provide transaction methods like withdraw, deposit, check balance, and transfer funds between accounts.
   - **Bank**: Manages multiple ATMs and users, allowing users to interact with the ATM system.
   
2. **Methods**:
   - **In the `ATM` class**:
     - A method to **authenticate** the user by validating the PIN.
     - A method to **withdraw money** from an account, ensuring there are sufficient funds.
     - A method to **deposit money** into an account.
     - A method to **check the balance** of an account.
     - A method to **transfer funds** between two accounts of the same user.
   
3. **Additional Considerations**:
   - Ensure that the system checks for valid account numbers and sufficient funds.
   - Handle cases where multiple users can access the same ATM but different accounts.
   - Implement security measures like PIN validation.

### How to Approach the Answer:

1. **Class Design and Relationships**: Start by defining key entities: `User`, `Account`, and `ATM`. Explain how users can interact with their accounts through the ATM.
2. **Security and Validation**: Focus on authentication (e.g., PIN validation), ensuring that transactions are secure and accurate.
3. **Real-world Constraints**: Mention real-world constraints such as handling daily withdrawal limits, network failures, and multi-user access.

### Example Implementation

```python
class Account:
    def __init__(self, accountNumber, balance):
        self.accountNumber = accountNumber
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        return self.balance

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if self.balance >= amount:
            self.balance -= amount
            return self.balance
        else:
            return None

    def check_balance(self):
        return self.balance

class User:
    def __init__(self, name, userID, pin):
        self.name = name
        self.userID = userID
        self.pin = pin
        self.accounts = []

    def add_account(self, account):
        self.accounts.append(account)

    def validate_pin(self, inputPin):
        return self.pin == inputPin

class ATM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.user = None

    def authenticate_user(self, user, pin):
        if user.validate_pin(pin):
            self.user = user
            return True
        return False

    def withdraw(self, account, amount):
        if self.user and account in self.user.accounts:
            return account.withdraw(amount)
        return None

    def deposit(self, account, amount):
        if self.user and account in self.user.accounts:
            return account.deposit(amount)
        return None

    def check_balance(self, account):
        if self.user and account in self.user.accounts:
            return account.check_balance()
        return None

    def transfer_funds(self, from_account, to_account, amount):
        if self.user and from_account in self.user.accounts and to_account in self.user.accounts:
            if from_account.withdraw(amount) is not None:
                to_account.deposit(amount)
                return True
        return False
```

### Key Points to Emphasize:
- **User Authentication**: Explain how the ATM system validates user PINs before allowing transactions.
- **Transaction Safety**: Mention how the system ensures that sufficient funds are available before completing withdrawals or transfers.
- **Modularity and Extensibility**: Emphasize how new features like setting withdrawal limits or handling overdrafts could be added to the design.
