### OOP Question: Design a Ride-Sharing System (e.g., Uber or Lyft)

**Question:**

Design a ride-sharing system using object-oriented principles. The system should allow drivers and passengers to connect, passengers to request rides, and drivers to accept ride requests.

**Requirements:**
1. **Classes**:
   - **User**: Represents a user of the system (both passengers and drivers). Attributes include name, user ID, and user type (passenger or driver).
   - **Driver**: A subclass of the `User` class with additional attributes like car details (e.g., license plate, car type) and current location.
   - **Passenger**: A subclass of the `User` class. It can request rides and track the ride status.
   - **Ride**: Represents a ride, containing attributes like pickup location, drop-off location, passenger, and driver.
   - **RideRequest**: Represents a request from a passenger for a ride.
   - **RideSharingSystem**: Manages the system by handling ride requests, matching drivers to passengers, and keeping track of rides in progress.

2. **Methods**:
   - In the `Passenger` class:
     - A method to request a ride.
     - A method to view the ride’s status.
   
   - In the `Driver` class:
     - A method to accept a ride request.
     - A method to update their availability and location.
   
   - In the `RideSharingSystem` class:
     - A method to match a driver with a passenger.
     - A method to manage ride requests and ride statuses.

3. **Additional Considerations**:
   - Handle cases where no drivers are available.
   - Consider tracking the status of the ride (e.g., pending, in-progress, completed).
   - Ensure the system allows multiple passengers and drivers to use it simultaneously.
   
### How to Approach the Answer:

1. **Define Classes and Their Relationships**: Start by defining the core classes and their interactions. For example, passengers make ride requests, and drivers fulfill them. Both are users, but have distinct behaviors.

2. **Class Inheritance**: Use inheritance for the `Passenger` and `Driver` classes as both share common attributes with the `User` class but also have distinct methods.

3. **Design Flexibility**: Mention how the system could be extended (e.g., adding pricing, ride history, or handling multiple drivers for a single passenger request).

4. **Concurrency**: Discuss how you might handle multiple ride requests and multiple drivers in a real-world scenario.

### Example Implementation

Here’s a basic implementation to illustrate the concept:

```python
class User:
    def __init__(self, name, user_id):
        self.name = name
        self.user_id = user_id

class Driver(User):
    def __init__(self, name, user_id, car_details):
        super().__init__(name, user_id)
        self.car_details = car_details
        self.current_location = None
        self.is_available = True

    def update_location(self, location):
        self.current_location = location

    def accept_ride(self, ride):
        if self.is_available:
            self.is_available = False
            ride.assign_driver(self)
            return True
        return False

    def complete_ride(self, ride):
        self.is_available = True

class Passenger(User):
    def request_ride(self, pickup, dropoff, system):
        ride_request = RideRequest(self, pickup, dropoff)
        return system.match_driver_to_ride(ride_request)

class Ride:
    def __init__(self, pickup_location, dropoff_location, passenger):
        self.pickup_location = pickup_location
        self.dropoff_location = dropoff_location
        self.passenger = passenger
        self.driver = None
        self.status = 'Pending'

    def assign_driver(self, driver):
        self.driver = driver
        self.status = 'In Progress'

    def complete_ride(self):
        self.status = 'Completed'

class RideRequest:
    def __init__(self, passenger, pickup_location, dropoff_location):
        self.passenger = passenger
        self.pickup_location = pickup_location
        self.dropoff_location = dropoff_location

class RideSharingSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.drivers = []
        self.rides = []

    def add_driver(self, driver):
        self.drivers.append(driver)

    def match_driver_to_ride(self, ride_request):
        available_driver = next((driver for driver in self.drivers if driver.is_available), None)
        if available_driver:
            new_ride = Ride(ride_request.pickup_location, ride_request.dropoff_location, ride_request.passenger)
            available_driver.accept_ride(new_ride)
            self.rides.append(new_ride)
            return new_ride
        return None
```

### How to Explain Your Design:

- **User Class Inheritance**: Explain why you used inheritance to create the `Passenger` and `Driver` classes from a base `User` class (since both have common attributes like name and user ID).
  
- **Ride Matching**: Discuss how the `RideSharingSystem` class is responsible for managing the drivers and matching them to ride requests. Mention that you used a simple loop to find an available driver, but this could be enhanced with a more efficient driver-matching algorithm.

- **Handling Ride Status**: Point out that the ride status moves through stages: "Pending", "In Progress", and "Completed", which could help in tracking the progress of rides.

- **Concurrency**: Acknowledge that in a real-world system, there would be more complexities such as multiple users and drivers interacting with the system simultaneously, and you would need to handle that with proper synchronization or concurrent handling mechanisms.

### Additional Discussion Points:

- **Scalability**: How would you handle thousands of ride requests simultaneously? Consider data structures and databases that might support this, such as Redis for managing real-time data.
  
- **Optimizations**: You could mention that in a larger system, you would optimize driver selection using proximity or availability windows rather than a simple loop.

This question tests your ability to apply OOP principles while also considering real-world system design complexities.
